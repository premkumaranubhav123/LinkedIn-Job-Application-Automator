Trying to Apply to "Software Engineer | Greylock Partner" job. Job ID: 4340863146
HR info was not given for "Software Engineer" with Job ID: 4340863146!

About the job
Greylock closely partners with just a handful of remarkable founders each year. Our portfolio includes iconic companies like Workday, Figma, Airbnb, and Roblox. Now, we’re backing a new enterprise AI startup tackling a problem that companies spend billions trying to solve, led by a repeat founder with a proven track record of success.

We’re looking for outstanding product or infrastructure software engineers who thrive in ambiguity, enjoy building from scratch, and love shaping early product development stages. The ideal candidate hopes to start a company someday but is eager to learn and grow by working closely with experienced leaders.

In this role, you will:

Define the core architecture and product direction from the very start.
Collaborate across backend, infrastructure, and product layers to solve complex engineering challenges—from distributed systems, APIs, and cloud services (AWS/GCP, Kubernetes, Postgres) to React/TypeScript for product development.
Work directly with the founder to influence both the product and the company’s future.

What we’re looking for:

Strong experience designing and building complex systems end-to-end.
Ability to thrive in an early-stage environment, moving quickly while upholding high standards.
Bonus if you’ve built enterprise integrations, workflow platforms, or internal tool builders.

This is a rare opportunity to join an early-stage, venture-backed company leading the next chapter in enterprise software.

Location: San Francisco (in-office)

About the role
This is a junior-level role where you'll spend your first 12–18 months dedicated to frontline engineering support, helping you gain technical fluency across our stack and build the foundations for your engineering career. Following this initial 12–18 month period, you will “graduate” into a more senior product engineering role, developing new features and capabilities.

Our engineering team is extremely small and we aim to keep it that way. This means that each person on our team carries significant weight and responsibility, and must ship a lot.

We’re looking for someone who’s eager to dive in, contribute, and launch their career at DX.

Key responsibilities
Manage our Engineering Support Rotation during your onboarding phase, solving real-world technical issues.
Collaborate with senior engineers to resolve bugs, optimize performance, and implement solutions.
Work closely with internal teams to ensure customers’ success.

About you
You’re a fast-learner who performs work with a high-level of intensity.
You’re able to take ownership, work under pressure, and meet deadlines on time.
You’re able to regularly work more than 40 hours/week—including after-hours or weekends when needed—to meet the workload and performance expectations that this role requires.
You have foundational knowledge of web application development.

Bonus points if you
Have startup experience
Have experience working with Ruby, React, and/or PostgreSQL

Why you’ll love working here
Mentorship & growth. You’ll work directly with senior engineers who will mentor you as you grow into a full-time product engineer.
Ownership & impact. You’ll see the direct results of your efforts in our product’s performance and customer satisfaction.
Collaborative culture. We’re a tight-knit team that values curiosity, knowledge sharing, and learning from one another.

Benefits
Competitive salary and meaningful equity in a high-growth-stage startup
401k with 4% match
Unlimited PTO
Fully covered medical insurance
