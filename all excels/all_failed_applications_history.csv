About the job
Founding Full-Stack Engineer | San Francisco | $130k–£180k + equity

I’m working with a YC-backed defense AI startup that’s scaling like crazy (60% MoM growth, profitable, $1M ARR inside 8 months, $3.3M raised). They’re building an AI platform that helps defense suppliers, from seatbelt makers to loitering munitions, win the right government contracts.

They’re lean, scrappy, and hiring their Founding Engineer to own massive parts of the stack, ship fast, and work directly with customers shaping mission-critical defense tech.

What you’ll be doing
Ship full-stack features daily (70/30 backend/frontend bias but comfortable across the stack)
Build AI agents + LLM-based workflows into production systems
Talk to users (defense companies, military stakeholders) and turn feedback into product decisions
Work on hard, ambiguous problems with huge national-security impact
Be in-person in San Francisco, with occasional travel to DC / military bases

What they’re looking for
0–4 YoE ideal (can flex up to 7 for exceptional talent)
Strong background in React, Next.js, Python
Ex-technical founder, founding CTO/CPO, or Forward Deployed Engineer background = big plus
Hungry, fast-moving builder who thrives with agency, feedback, and ambiguity
US citizen only (no visa sponsorship)

Package
$130k–$180k
SF office, 5 days/week

About the job
About DX
DX helps companies build world-class engineering organizations by providing leaders with insights into developer experience and productivity. DX is bootstrapped, profitable, and consistently growing revenue more than 3X year over year. We’re based in downtown Salt Lake City with customers like Indeed, Etsy, Dropbox, Twilio, Pfizer, and Vanguard.

About the role
This is a junior-level role where you'll spend your first 12–18 months dedicated to frontline engineering support, helping you gain technical fluency across our stack and build the foundations for your engineering career. Following this initial 12–18 month period, you will “graduate” into a more senior product engineering role, developing new features and capabilities.

Our engineering team is extremely small and we aim to keep it that way. This means that each person on our team carries significant weight and responsibility, and must ship a lot. In return, we have great compensation, zero bureaucracy, little to no meetings, and the opportunity to immensely impact the business each day. We’re looking for someone who’s eager to dive in, contribute, and launch their career at DX.

Key responsibilities
Manage our Engineering Support Rotation during your onboarding phase, solving real-world technical issues.
Collaborate with senior engineers to resolve bugs, optimize performance, and implement solutions.
Work closely with internal teams to ensure customers’ success.

About you
You’re a fast-learner who performs work with a high-level of intensity.
You’re able to take ownership, work under pressure, and meet deadlines on time.
You’re able to regularly work more than 40 hours/week—including after-hours or weekends when needed—to meet the workload and performance expectations that this role requires.
You have foundational knowledge of web application development.

Bonus points if you
Have startup experience
Have experience working with Ruby, React, and/or PostgreSQL

Why you’ll love working here
Mentorship & growth. You’ll work directly with senior engineers who will mentor you as you grow into a full-time product engineer.
Ownership & impact. You’ll see the direct results of your efforts in our product’s performance and customer satisfaction.
Collaborative culture. We’re a tight-knit team that values curiosity, knowledge sharing, and learning from one another.

Benefits
Competitive salary and meaningful equity in a high-growth-stage startup
401k with 4% match
Unlimited PTO
Fully covered medical insurance
